<h2>Virtual Keyboard </h2>

<p>By default, BSSH is set to use <strong>Landscape</strong>
mode. However, you may find that in <strong>Landscape</strong> mode,
the virtual keyboard takes up a large part of your screen. Therefore,
you may prefer to use BSSH with a virtual keyboard in <strong>Portrait</strong>
mode in order to see more lines on the terminal.</p>

<p>To change this setting, at the <strong>Host List</strong> swipe
from the top of the screen down and select <strong>Settings</strong>.
Then, select your preference in <strong>Rotation mode</strong>.</p>

<p>On devices without a hardware keyboard, you may swipe from the bottom
left corner diagonally inward to bring up the virtual keyboard. Please note
that this applies to any program on the Blackberry platform - it is not
BSSH specific.</p>

<p>Swipe from the bottom diagonally left or right in order to go 
<strong>back</strong> within the program.

<h2>How to Enter Control, Alt, Escape, and Function Keys</h2>
<p>Tap the screen while connected to a host to see on-screen
shortcuts to <strong>Ctrl</strong>, <strong>ESC</strong>, a table of
symbols (<strong>SYM</strong>), and the virtual keyboard (a picture of a
keyboard).</p>

<p>You can enter any key combination with BSSH and the virtual
keyboard, but you must know how keys are mapped on a normal console. For
instance, usually combinations of ALT+letter on a PC keyboard are
actually mapped to sending, sequentially, ESC key then the letter.</p>

<p> Here are some important keys not present on the virtual keyboard and in
an on-screen shortcut:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Tab key</strong> = <strong>CTRL + i</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Function key</strong> = <strong>CTRL + number</strong>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Note there are also screen gestures: see the ScreenGestures help topic for
help on <strong>Page Up</strong>, <strong>Page Down</strong>, <strong>Scrolling</strong>, and <strong>Switching hosts</strong>.</p>
