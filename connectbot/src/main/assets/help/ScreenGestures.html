<h2>Screen Gestures</h2>

<p>Gestures in ConnectBot allow a user to do several things for
which there&#x27;s no keyboard equivalent. If the gestures seem
backward, then imagine that you&#x27;re grabbing the text and moving it
with your finger.</p>

<h3><a name="Page_Up_/_Page_Down" />Page Up / Page Down</h3>
<p>Swiping your finger up and down on the left third of the screen
will send a page up and page down key to the remote host. Many programs
map this to scrolling back into history such as irssi or tinyfugue.</p>

<h3><a name="Scroll_back_/_Scroll_forward" />Scroll Back / Scroll
Forward</h3>
<p>Swiping your finger up on the right side of the screen allows you
to scroll backward and forward in the local terminal buffer history.</p>

<h3><a name="Switching_hosts" />Switch Between Hosts (Connections)</h3>
<p>Swiping your finger from one side of the screen to the other will
switch between currently connected hosts.</p>

<h3><a name="Going_Back" />Going Back</h3>
<p>When you are viewing a host, you can go "back" to the main screen
with the list of hosts by swiping diagonally left or right from beyond
the bottom edge of the screen.</p>

<h3><a name="Getting_Menu" />Getting the Context Menu</h3>
<p>In any screen of the application, you can get a context menu by
swiping down from beyond the top edge of the screen.</p>
