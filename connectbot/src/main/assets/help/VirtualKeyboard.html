<h2>Virtual Keyboard </h2>

<p>By default, BSSH is set to use <strong>Landscape</strong>
mode. However, you may find that in <strong>Landscape</strong> mode,
the virtual keyboard takes up a large part of your screen. Therefore,
you may prefer to use BSSH with a virtual keyboard in <strong>Portrait</strong>
mode in order to see more lines on the terminal.</p>

<p>To change this setting, at the <strong>Host List</strong> swipe
from the top of the screen down and select <strong>Settings</strong>.
Then, select your preference in <strong>Rotation mode</strong>.</p>

<p>On devices without a hardware keyboard, you may swipe from the bottom
left corner diagonally inward to bring up the virtual keyboard. Please note
that this applies to any program on the Blackberry platform - it is not
BSSH specific.</p>

<p>Swipe from the bottom diagonally left or right in order to go 
<strong>back</strong> within the program.

<h2>How to Enter Control, Alt, Escape, Tab, and Function Keys</h2>
<p>Tap the screen while connected to a host to see on-screen
shortcuts to <strong>Ctrl</strong>, <strong>ESC</strong>, a table of
symbols (<strong>SYM</strong>), and the virtual keyboard (a picture of a
keyboard).</p>

<p>You can enter any key combination with BSSH and the virtual
keyboard, but you must know how keys are mapped on a normal console. For
instance, usually combinations of ALT+letter on a PC keyboard are
actually mapped to sending, sequentially, ESC key then the letter.</p>

<p> Here are some important keys neither present on the virtual keyboard nor in
an on-screen shortcut:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Tab</strong>                = <strong>Ctrl + i</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Up Arrow</strong>           = <strong>Ctrl + p</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Down Arrow</strong>         = <strong>Ctrl + n</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Left Arrow</strong>         = <strong>Ctrl + b</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Right Arrow</strong>        = <strong>Ctrl + f</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Home</strong>               = <strong>Ctrl + a</strong></li>
	<li><strong>End</strong>                = <strong>Ctrl + e</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Cut (after cursor)</strong> = <strong>Ctrl + k</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Paste (at cursor)</strong>  = <strong>Ctrl + y</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Skip Forward Word</strong>  = <strong>Esc  + f</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Skip Back Word</strong>     = <strong>Esc  + b</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Function Keys</strong>      = <strong>Ctrl + numbers 1-9</strong>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Note there are also screen gestures: see the ScreenGestures help topic for
help on <strong>Page Up</strong>, <strong>Page Down</strong>, 
<strong>Scrolling</strong>, <strong>Switching hosts</strong>, 
and <strong>Going Back</strong>.</p>
